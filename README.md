# Tic-Tac-Toe
Java application that implements a two-player game of Tic Tac Toe


Use a two-dimensional array of chars to represent the board. Use blanks rather than null values to represent unoccupied squares. 
You can create the board as follows (note that there are blanks between the single quotes, even though this may not be clear in your 
browser):
char [][] board ={{' ',' ',' '},
                  {' ',' ',' '},
                  {' ',' ',' '}};
Create an enum called Player whose possible values are "X" and "O". Use a variable called turn, whose data type is Player, to keep track of 
which player should move next. Each time a player moves, toggle the value of turn to indicate that the turn has changed; 
if the value was "X", set it to "O", otherwise set it to "X".
For each move, show the current state of the board, indicate whose turn it is, and ask for the next move. 
You may use either Console or JOptionPane I/O, but do not mix them. There are various reasonable formats for the input, but one possibility 
is to ask separately for the row and column of the square the user wants to occupy.
Use the user input to update the board. Do not allow moves to squares that are already occupied.
This is the hard part. After each move, run a method that determines whether or not a player has won the game. 
Consider all eight possible ways to win. If a player has won, provide output that indicates the victor.
After each move, run a method that determines whether the board is full. If it is, print a message that indicates the game is at a stalemate.  
If you want a hard extra challenge, write and use a method that determines whether the game is stalemated even if the board is not full.
